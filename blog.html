                            I've been going over the official react native tutorials and I have to say I've been having a blast. Over a year ago, a friend
                            and I tried to make a project in React and I remember struggling with the concepts because my
                            experience with web development was so limited. We ultimately didn't get anywhere so now it's
                            in an abandoned repo.

                        </p>

                            I know ReactJS and React Native aren't exactly the same, but anyways, this time things just clicked. It just felt gratifying
                            to see my progress. Before I lacked the foundational knowledge to gain a footing on all the new
                            concepts, but after a year of web development playing with different frameworks, the experience
                            really helped in the learning process. When you're introduced to new concepts, it helps to draw
                            from experience to gain a familiarity based on relative knowledge. You notice where you've seen
                            things before. I could go, "Oh, they're shifting this to do that", "This is like x in y, but
                            for z." Things are hard, but then they get easier and I'm pumped to churn something out before
                            classes pick up. Granted, I've only completed the basics section BUT I can expect to deploy my
                            revolutionary billion dollar app idea sometime this <span style="text-decoration: line-through">week</span> year so yeah I'm pretty pumped.

                            I've never blogged before, but with spring break here, and me discovering a lot of things I want to play with, I decided
                            it would be a nice way to formalize my thoughts.

                            There's a lot of things I want to try out this time and I plan on working in smaller increments. That is, instead of jumping
                            straight into new ideas with new stacks and frameworks, I actually want to work through tutorials
                            and smaller scale projects. I think it'll be a good way to gain a solid foundation, while ensuring
                            I don't get overwhelmed and discouraged. I guess I'll start naming them off in order, and we'll
                            see what happens!
