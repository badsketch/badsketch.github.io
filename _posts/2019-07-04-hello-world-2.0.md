It's been more than a year since the last blog post even though I told myself I would be consistent with it. yikes.
I've learned so much this past year and I'm still hungry for more. My first reentry to personal projects is brushing up
this old personal website by transitioning it to jekyll. Same look, same (not so great) taste! But under the hood, it's way more
elegant and extensible. Creating posts is so much faster. Also, check it: 

<div class="snippet">
    {% highlight javascript %}
    function foo() {
        var text = 'I added styles to make these pretty code snippets!';
        console.log(text);
    }
    foo();
    {% endhighlight %}
</div>

It's so strange. Even though jekyll is advertised heavily on the github pages setup and I saw it back then, 
I couldn't really tell what it was used for. And just a few days ago when I thought of blogging again,
I kept thinking, 'man I really don't wanna go back to copy and pasting html for every post; there has to be a better way. I wonder if there's
a tool out there for that?' And then as I'm looking it up, the first thing I see is: 

<img src="/assets/images/jekyll.png" width="60%" />

How did I miss this?? It seems so obvious. I think it ultimately had to do with the depth of my knowledge at the time.
There are so many new technologies popping up like netlify, gatsby, svelte, React hooks in the react world, etc (all of which I wanna try out).
And since I'm still relatively early in my career, it's really difficult to assess and internalize all these 'solutions'
when I don't know anything about the problems they're trying to solve! I'm sort of echoing my last post about building relative knowledge,
but I think it's fitting that a year later into my first job, I'm still overwhelmed (in a good way), there's still so much to learn, and I'm ready to keep exploring.
