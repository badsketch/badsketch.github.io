I've never blogged before, but with spring break here, and me discovering a lot of things I want to play with, I decided
it would be a nice way to formalize my thoughts.

There's a lot of things I want to try out this time and I plan on working in smaller increments. That is, instead of jumping
straight into new ideas with new stacks and frameworks, I actually want to work through tutorials
and smaller scale projects. I think it'll be a good way to gain a solid foundation, while ensuring
I don't get overwhelmed and discouraged. I guess I'll start naming them off in order, and we'll
see what happens!
