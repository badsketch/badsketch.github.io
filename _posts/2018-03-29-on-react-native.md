I've been going over the official react native tutorials and I have to say I've been having a blast. Over a year ago, a friend and I tried to make a project in React and I remember struggling with the concepts because my experience with web development was so limited. We ultimately didn't get anywhere so now it's in an abandoned repo.

I know ReactJS and React Native aren't exactly the same, but anyways, this time things just clicked. It just felt gratifying to see my progress. Before I lacked the foundational knowledge to gain a footing on all the new concepts, but after a year of web development playing with different frameworks, the experience really helped in the learning process. When you're introduced to new concepts, it helps to draw from experience to gain a familiarity based on relative knowledge. You notice where you've seen things before. I could go, "Oh, they're shifting this to do that", "This is like x in y, but
for z." Things are hard, but then they get easier and I'm pumped to churn something out before classes pick up. Granted, I've only completed the basics section BUT I can expect to deploy my
revolutionary billion dollar app idea sometime this ~~week~~ year so yeah I'm pretty pumped.
